## Tutorials/Lessons

[Datacamp "Introduction to R"](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)<br>
Free 4hr course to get your feet wet in an interactive tutorial.

[Introduction to R](https://r-unimelb.gitbook.io/rbook/)<br>
A short introduction to R for non-programmers, to get them familiar with RStudio and the fundamentals of R for basic data analysis.

[fasteR: Fast Lane to Learning R!](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR)<br>
An introduction to R for non-programmers, created by Norm Matloff (U.C. Davis). This course has some notable features:<br>
* No use of integrated development environments (IDEs) such as RStudio - all work is done purely in the R console.
* Base R is the focus of learning, not external packages. Norm does NOT like the Tidyverse, as he has made clear in [this *enormous* essay](https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic) (and a [shorter 'greatly revised' version](https://matloff.wordpress.com/2022/04/02/greatly-revised-edition-of-tidyverse-skeptic/)).

[R You With Me](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/01-basicbasics-0/)<br>
A series of online learning resources for using R. Oriented towards R beginners and aims to provide a solid foundation of R skills. Created by the group [R-Ladies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org/).

[NCEAS OSS-2017 Lessons & Materials](https://nceas.github.io/oss-2017/)<br>
Online materials associated with a 3-week course - the Open Science for Synthesis: Gulf Research Program Workshop (OSS-2017). OSS-2017 was designed for both early career and established researchers to gain skills in data science, including scientific synthesis, reproducible science, and data management. NCEAS (National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis, at University of California, Santa Barbara) freely shares this on their Learning Hub.

[NCEAS Learning Hub's 'CoreR Course' (Oct 2023)](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2023-10-coreR/)<br>
Online course materials to accompany a five-day immersion workshop in R programming for environmental data science. NCEAS (National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis, at University of California, Santa Barbara) freely shares this on their Learning Hub.

## Data Management and Research Ethics
[NCEAS Learning Hub's 'Open Science: Best Practices, Data Sovereignty and Co-production'](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2022-03-assw/index.html)<br>
Extensive discussion of Indigenous data sovereignty, principles for handling community data, and the ethics of open data in research. NCEAS (National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis, at University of California, Santa Barbara) freely shares this on their Learning Hub.

## Cheatsheets
[Cheatsheets repository (RStudio)](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/tree/main)<br>
An entire GitHub repository devoted to cheatsheets, created by the RStudio team!

## Best Practices Guides
[R Code - Best Practices (R-bloggers, 2018)](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/09/r-code-best-practices/)<br>
Some tips for coding and organizational practices to make your life (and your teammates' lives) easier.

[Project-Oriented Workflow (Jenny Bryan, 2017)](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)<br>
Guidance on using Projects within RStudio to improve clarity and transferability of code. Intended to get people away from hardcoding directories and other workflow-specific elements into their scripts. Bit of a rant, but also good information.

[Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing (Wilson et al, 2017)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)<br>
Frequently cited in the scientific R community, this article in the journal PLOS outlines 'good enough' (i.e., effective but also reasonably easy to learn and implement) practices for data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts.

## Style guides

[The tidyverse style guide (Wickham, 2019)](https://style.tidyverse.org/)<br>
A widely-accepted guide to formatting your R code. This style is used in the "tidyverse" packages (e.g. ggplot, dplyr, etc) and references certain tidyverse constructs that aren't universal (e.g. magrittr).

[Travis Gerke's 'R code review checklist' (Gerke, 2021)](https://github.com/tgerke/r-code-review-checklist)<br>
Before sharing R code, run through this checklist! It's mainly oriented for people sharing whole repositories/projects, not just individual scripts. However, many of the tenets are still very much applicable to individual scripts!

[Code Smells and Feels (Jenny Bryan, 2018)](https://github.com/jennybc/code-smells-and-feels)<br>
A list of thoughts and links for improving coding practice, created to support a conference presentation Jenny was giving on this subject.

## Textbooks (all books are free and online unless otherwise specified!)

[R for Beginners (Paradis, 2005)](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf)<br>
An introduction to some of the basic concepts of R.

[R for Data Science, 2nd edition (Wickham, 2023)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)<br>
Some familiarity with R is assumed, but not much. Works a lot with the "tidyverse" packages (e.g. dplyr, tidyr), so familiarity with base R is less important.

[Modern Data Visualization with R (Kabacoff, 2024)](https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/)<br>
Guide to plots and visualizations in R. Heavy use of ggplot2 package. Author Robert Kabacoff.

[Efficient R Programming (Gillespie and Lovelace, 2016)](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/)<br>
For a range of experience levels. The main focus is on optimizing your system and writing fast/efficient code - including how to quantify and compare code efficiency.

## Groups
[R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/)<br>
R-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community. They have >100K members in 219 chapters in 63 countries (as of 2024-03-13). They have a mentoring program, they organize events, and they feature the blogs of hundreds of their members.
