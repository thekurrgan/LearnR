## Textbooks

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)<br>
Some familiarity with R is assumed, but not much. Works a lot with the "tidyverse" packages (e.g. ggplot, dplyr, tidyr), so familiarity with base R is less important.

[Efficient R Programming (Gillespie and Lovelace, 2016)](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/)<br>
For a range of experience levels. The main focus is on optimizing your system and writing fast/efficient code - including how to quantify and compare code efficiency.
