## Tutorials/Lessons

#[Datacamp "Introduction to R"](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)<br>
Free 4hr course to get your feet wet in an interactive tutorial.

#[Introduction to R](https://r-unimelb.gitbook.io/rbook/)<br>
A short introduction to R for non-programmers, to get them familiar with RStudio and the fundamentals of R for basic data analysis.

#[fasteR: Fast Lane to Learning R!](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR)<br>
An introduction to R for non-programmers, created by Norm Matloff (U.C. Davis). This course has some notable features:<br>
* No use of integrated development environments (IDEs) such as RStudio - all work is done purely in the R console.
* Base R is the focus of learning, not external packages. Norm does NOT like the Tidyverse, as he has made clear in [this *enormous* essay](https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic) (and a [shorter 'greatly revised' version](https://matloff.wordpress.com/2022/04/02/greatly-revised-edition-of-tidyverse-skeptic/)).

#[R You With Me](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/01-basicbasics-0/)<br>
A series of online learning resources for using R. Oriented towards R beginners and aims to provide a solid foundation of R skills. Created by the group [R-Ladies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org/).

## Best Practices Guides
#[R Code - Best Practices (R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/09/r-code-best-practices/)<br>
Some tips for coding and organizational practices to make your life (and your teammates' lives) easier.

#[Project-Oriented Workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)<br>
Guidance on using Projects within RStudio to improve clarity and transferability of code. Intended to get people away from hardcoding directories and other workflow-specific elements into their scripts. Bit of a rant, but also good information.

## Style guides

#[The tidyverse style guide (Wickham)](https://style.tidyverse.org/)<br>
A widely-accepted guide to formatting your R code. This style is used in the "tidyverse" packages (e.g. ggplot, dplyr, etc) and references certain tidyverse constructs that aren't universal (e.g. magrittr).

## Textbooks (all books are free and online unless otherwise specified!)

#[R for Beginners (Paradis, 2005)](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf)<br>
An introduction to some of the basic concepts of R.

#[R for Data Science, 2nd edition (Wickham)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)<br>
Some familiarity with R is assumed, but not much. Works a lot with the "tidyverse" packages (e.g. dplyr, tidyr), so familiarity with base R is less important.

#[Modern Data Visualization with R (Kabacoff)](https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/)<br>
Guide to plots and visualizations in R. Heavy use of ggplot2 package. Author Robert Kabacoff.

#[Efficient R Programming (Gillespie and Lovelace, 2016)](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/)<br>
For a range of experience levels. The main focus is on optimizing your system and writing fast/efficient code - including how to quantify and compare code efficiency.

## Groups
#[R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/)<br>
