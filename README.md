## Tutorials/Lessons

[Datacamp "Introduction to R"](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)<br>
Free 4hr course to get your feet wet in an interactive tutorial.

[Introduction to R](https://r-unimelb.gitbook.io/rbook/)<br>
A short introduction to R for non-programmers, to get them familiar with RStudio and the fundamentals of R for basic data analysis.

## Best Practices Guides
[R Code - Best Practices (R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/09/r-code-best-practices/)<br>
Some tips for coding and organizational practices to make your life (and your teammates' lives) easier.

[Project-Oriented Workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)<br>
Guidance on using Projects within RStudio to improve clarity and transferability of code. Intended to get people away from hardcoding directories and other workflow-specific elements into their scripts. Bit of a rant, but also good information.

## Style guides

[The tidyverse style guide (Wickham)](https://style.tidyverse.org/)<br>
A widely-accepted guide to formatting your R code. This style is used in the "tidyverse" packages (e.g. ggplot, dplyr, etc) and references certain tidyverse constructs that aren't universal (e.g. magrittr).

## Textbooks (all books are free and online unless otherwise specified!)

[R for Beginners (Paradis, 2005)](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf)<br>
An introduction to some of the basic concepts of R.

[R for Data Science, 2nd edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)<br>
Some familiarity with R is assumed, but not much. Works a lot with the "tidyverse" packages (e.g. ggplot, dplyr, tidyr), so familiarity with base R is less important.

[Modern Data Visualization with R](https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/)<br>
Guide to plots and visualizations in R. Heavy use of ggplot2 package. Author Robert Kabacoff.

[Efficient R Programming (Gillespie and Lovelace, 2016)](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/)<br>
For a range of experience levels. The main focus is on optimizing your system and writing fast/efficient code - including how to quantify and compare code efficiency.
